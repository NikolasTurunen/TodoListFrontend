Instructions:
1. Open the project in NetBeans-IDE.
2. Click "Resolve Problems..."
3. Resolve "Missing Bower modules"
4. Click "Close" ("Invalid Unit Tests" cannot be Resolved because there are no unit tests in the frontend)
5. Run the project.

The frontend should now be opened in the browser.
Start by clicking the arrow on the bottom-left corner.
This arrow might seem odd but it is there because i run the frontend in a JavaFX WebView-component in a window that does not have the title bar. This is because i find it useful to have the todolist at a predefined location on the screen without the possibility to move, close, or minimize it. The window starts on system startup so the todolist is always quickly accessible.
